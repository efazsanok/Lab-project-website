                <p>
                    <strong>Green Bangladesh</strong> is more than just a website; we are a growing community of
                    students, professionals, and nature enthusiasts dedicated to saving our environment. Founded in
                    2024, our goal is simple: to combat the rising temperatures in our cities and restore the natural
                    beauty of our motherland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you have a rooftop garden in Dhaka or a large backyard in Sylhet, we believe everyone can
                    contribute to a greener planet. We act as a bridge between people who want to plant trees and the
                    knowledge they need to do it right.

                <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, but it is also one of the most
                    vulnerable to climate change. We have seen our seasons change, our summers become unbearable, and
                    our air quality drop.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <em>"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    We do this because we want our children to breathe clean air. We do this because a green city is a
                    happy city. We believe that small collective actions can lead to massive change.

                            <li><strong>Cleaner Air:</strong> Trees absorb CO2 and release fresh Oxygen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature Control:</strong> Trees cool down the city by providing shade and
                                moisture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Green spaces reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> Provides a home for birds, bees, and squirrels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fruit & Medicine:</strong> A source of natural food and healing.</li>

                            <li><strong>Heat Islands:</strong> Cities like Dhaka will become unbearably hot concrete
                                jungles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Increase in dust and toxic gases leading to lung
                                diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Soil Erosion:</strong> Without roots to hold soil, riverbanks and lands wash
                                away.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flooding:</strong> Fewer trees mean less water absorption during heavy rains.

                            <li><strong>Loss of Wildlife:</strong> Extinction of native birds and insects.</li>
